# Sameric Services website


### Purpose
I always aim to keep my code clean and simple and by only using HTML and CSS I have updated and amended our original website to make it responsive and more attractive for potential clients.
I run a small family property management business and created a quick website using wix in order to outline what we do and a means for clients to know where to go to contact us however it was a very generic website.
the purpose of this website is to create an updated and bespoke version of the original site for clients to be able to sign up if they are interested in what we have to offer aswell as keep updated on what we have going on.


### UX
This website for Landlord that want to maximise there property investment without having to worry about the day to day maangement and maintenece of there property.
Any Landlord that has had to deal with tenant complaints or poor service from letting agents will benefit greatly through what we do and helping them is what we hope to achieve.
I have created a simple easy to read website clearly outlining the service we offer, how to get in contact to arrange an offer or for any other property questions or queries.
In the future as the business grows I intend to add an investors page and a blog in order to highlight our success and also a paltform for investors to also purchase and sell property.

#### User Stories 
- A Landlord wants to know more about the rent to rent model so can visit our how it works page for a complete breakdown
- A potential client wants to see examples of properties we have taken on and refurbished they can visit the Lanlord page and look at the slide show.
- A client wants to register there interest of enquire on an offer the can visit the contact us page and fill in the form.
- A client wants to have a think with there partner or family member and wants to take some literature to show them they can download our letter to landlords on the 
contact us page.

#### Wireframes 


### Features
- Header - I used  primarily CSS to create a dropdown menu in order for clients to navigate through the website.
- Home page- I used the jumbotron feature to emphasize our slogan so that veiwers are drawn in.
- Landlord page - I used the slider tag and keyframes in order to create a slide show of refurbished properties so that potential clients can see what we can do.
- Howitworks page - I used the icons tag to visually represent the process of how it works so the veiwer does get board of reading loads of text.
- Faqs page - I used borders padding and margins to make the center-text stand out and keep consistent with the theme of the website. I also used a mediaQuery in order to thin the the styling and maintain a good responsive look on smaller screens.
- Contactus page - Used a form in order for user to imput details to build our client database and assist people with the management of there home.


### Features left to implement 
The use of Javascript will enable a better slide that will cache and load faster and a dropdown navigation bar would look better and will be the features I will implement when website is updated 
Also, as the business grows I will add links to our social media and youtube accounts once they are created


### Technologies used
####HTML -https://html.com/ - I used HTML for the structure of my website as it is the best language to do so
####CSS -https://css-tricks.com/ - I used CSS to style and customise the website to give it a bespoke look and user friendly theme and feel 
####bootstrap -https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/ - I usded bootstrap framework to develop responsive, mobile first website


### Testing 
In order to make sure website functions well I opened it on the main webrowswers: Google Chrome, Internet explorer, Firefox and safari and they all show a good responsive website with the fastest to load being chrome and the slowest being firefox.
I do think in order to create a better user experience Javascript should be used to create better slide and a faster page but will be sufficent for the task at hand and a basic website that assists Landlords and managing there property.
