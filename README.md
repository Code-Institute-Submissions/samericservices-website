# Sameric Services website


### Purpose
I always aim to keep my code clean and simple and by using HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery I have updated and amended our original website to make it responsive and more attractive for potential clients.
I run a small family property management business and created a quick website using wix in order to outline what we do and a means for clients to know where to go to contact us however it was a very generic website.
the purpose of this website is to create an updated and bespoke version of the original site for clients to be able to sign up if they are interested in what we have to offer aswell as keep updated on what we have going on.


### UX
This website for Landlord that want to maximise there property investment without having to worry about the day to day maangement and maintenece of there property.
Any Landlord that has had to deal with tenant complaints or poor service from letting agents will benefit greatly through what we do and helping them is what we hope to achieve.
I have created a simple easy to read website clearly outlining the service we offer, how to get in contact to arrange an offer or for any other property questions or queries.
In the future as the business grows I intend to add an investors page and a blog in order to highlight our success and also a paltform for investors to also purchase and sell property.

#### User Stories 
- A Landlord wants to know more about the rent to rent model so can visit our how it works page for a complete breakdown
- A potential client wants to see examples of properties we have taken on and refurbished they can visit the Lanlord page and look at the slide show.
- A client wants to register there interest of enquire on an offer the can visit the contact us page and fill in the form.
- A client wants to have a think with there partner or family member and wants to take some literature to show them they can download our letter to landlords on the 
contact us page.

#### Wireframes 


### Features
- Header - I used  primarily jQuery andCSS to create a dropdown menu in order for clients to navigate through the website.
- Home page- I used the jumbotron feature to emphasize our slogan so that veiwers are drawn in.
- Landlord page - I used slick in order to create a slide show of refurbished properties so that potential clients can see what we can do.
- Howitworks page - I used the icons tag to visually represent the process of how it works so the veiwer does get board of reading loads of text.
- Faqs page - I used borders padding and margins to make the center-text stand out and keep consistent with the theme of the website. I also used a mediaQuery in order to thin the the styling and maintain a good responsive look on smaller screens.
- Contactus page - Used a form in order for user to imput details to build our client database and assist people with the management of there home.


### Features left to implement 
As the business progresses I will create an investors page where Landlord who may want to buy or sell their properties can register their interest i will also add more pictures.
Possibly a running carousell for the testimonials however this is not a neccessity as it is already shown in printable pdf.

### Technologies used
#### https://html.com/ - I used HTML for the structure of my website as it is the best language to do so
#### https://css-tricks.com/ - I used CSS to style and customise the website to give it a bespoke look and user friendly theme and feel 
#### https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/ - I usded bootstrap framework to develop responsive, mobile first website
#### https://jquery.com/ I use jQuery to handle some of the functionality of the site
#### http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ - I used Slick to create a user freindly carousell for viewers of my site to be able to see some of the refurbished properties we manage.
#### https://fontawesome.com/ - I used fontawesome for all my icons throughout the site
#### https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Roboto&query=ex - I used google fonts to pick the font for my site 


### Testing 
I initially used a dropdown menu that I had created from an earlier excercise using pure CSS and the company logo However after testing it proved not to be the best option as the logo did not flow with the look of the page and it was hard to determine where the menu was as it was hidden behind the image.
After further research and advice from my mentor I used jquery and bootstrap to create a responsive navbar that collapses on smaller screens so as not to take up too much real estate.

I also used pure CSS to create my slider carousell for the images of my refurbished properties and used keyframes and animations in order to make them continously move however after recieving feed abck from friends, fellow students and my mentor I realised it was not a good idea as it looked like too much was going on the webpage would take too long to load so this was not very user friendly. 
I rectified this by using the slick feature which incorporates jquery to make a much better slider that the enables the user to flick through images with ease. I really struggled to get the slider to run at first but with further resaerch on slack I rectified the error.

At first I had a testimonials section within the front page of my site but after reveiwng this I realised it overcrowed the first page and came across as overwhelming to the veiwer.
I handle this by attaching a download link on the contact us page with our letter to landlords that gives you a full breakdown of the key points on the webpage aswell as all our testimonials.

after testing the responsiveness of my site i realise that some of the texts borders and images seemed to come out of place on the smaller webpages and i corrected this by wrapping my content in containers
and using mediaQuery tp change the thickness of my borders on smallest screens (from 425px).

I also had an about us page but after discussing with my mentor and recieving feedback from veiwers I chose to remove there was no need for a whole page a summary in the footer was precise and sufficient.

Although I dimmed the background image on the how it works page when testing  realise text was not so visible so I added a text-shadow to my CSS to make the works stand out and read clearly.
