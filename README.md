# Sameric Services website


### Purpose
I always aim to keep my code clean and simple and by only using HTML and CSS I have updated and amended our original website to make it responsive and more attractive for potential clients.
I run a small family property management business and created a quick website using wix in order to outline what we do and a means for clients to know where to go to contact us however it was a very generic website.
the purpose of this website is to create an updated and bespoke version of the original site for clients to be able to sign up if they are interested in what we have to offer aswell as keep updated on what we have going on.


### UX
This website for Landlord that want to maximise there property investment without having to worry about the day to day maangement and maintenece of there property.
Any Landlord that has had to deal with tenant complaints or poor service from letting agents will benefit greatly through what we do and helping them is what we hope to achieve.
I have created a simple easy to read website clearly outlining the service we offer, how to get in contact to arrange an offer or for any other property questions or queries.
In the future as the business grows I intend to add an investors page and a blog in order to highlight our success and also a paltform for investors to also purchase and sell property.

#### Wireframes 


### Features
- Header - I used CSS and HMTL to create a dropdown menu in order for clients to navigate through the website.
- Home page- I used the jumbotron feature to emphasize our slogan so that veiwers are drawn in.
- landlord page - I used the slider tag and keyframes in order to create a slide show of refurbished properties so that potential clients can see what we can do.
- howitworks page - I used the icons tag to visually represent the process of how it works so the veiwer does get board of reading loads of text.
