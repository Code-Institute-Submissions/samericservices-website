      <h4>What is SAMERIC SERVICES responsible for?</h4>
      <p>We are responsible for paying you the set monthly rental fee each month. We fill the house with our professional tenants, we ensure all of the utilities and council tax are paid, we hire a cleaner and a gardener (where applicable) to watch over
        the property and take care of the communal areas. We are the first point of call for the tenants if they have any problems. We act as the landlord and take over all of the landlord responsibilities so that you don’t have to worry about any of
        it. Because our tenants expect the highest quality and standards we generally need to spend money up-front in order to make the house suitable. There will be no cost to you for any interior upgrade work, decoration or furniture.</p></li>
      </br>
      <li><i class="fas fa-question"></i>
      <h4>Will I still make the same amount of money as usual?</h4>
      <p>Yes! You tell us how much you want to get paid! We generally pay about the same amount of money as you would earn if you were to let your property normally and we guarantee payment every month. The exact monthly amount and the time period will be
        agreed between us. </p></li>
      </br>
      <li><i class="fas fa-question"></i>
      <h4>Am I responsible for anything at all?</h4>
      <p>As a landlord, you will need to make sure the exterior/structure of the building is sound. SAMERIC SERVICES is not liable for repairs to these parts of the home (for example, roof tiles and structural soundness). As a responsible landlord, you should
        make sure the building is insured with the appropriate HMO landlord product, and that you have adequate safety and environmental certificates in place (e.g. Gas safety, Electrical Safety, EPC). Finally, if you have one, it is your responsibility
        to look after your own mortgage.</p></li>
      </br>
      <li><i class="fas fa-question"></i>
      <h4>How does SAMERIC SERVICES make its money?</h4>
      <p>Unlike estate agents we do not charge you any fees or commissions. We earn our commission from the tenant that we put in to the house. Because we work with local companies to rent to their professional employees and provide quality housing with
        flexible length terms and professional services we are able to receive a mark-up on the monthly rent. That may sound like a lot of work for us, but it does not matter – your payments are guaranteed every month and you does not have to lift a finger.</p></li>
      </br>
      <li><i class="fas fa-question"></i>
      <h4>Is this sub-letting?</h4>
      <p>No. SAMERIC SERVICES do not have an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) with the owner of the property. The AST is the contract that disallows sub-letting and is not appropriate in this situation. The contract that we use has been drawn up by a solicitor
        specifically for these types of arrangements. </p></li>
