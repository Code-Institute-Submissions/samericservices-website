        <h2 class="text-center">We effectively become your tenants</h2>
        <p>Many landlords prefer tenants who are professionals; we become your professional tenants. You will only ever deal with us, as the contract is between us and you (the landlord).</p>
        <p>We take great care in selecting the right kind of tenants because if they stop paying, leave suddenly or damage the property, we take the financial hit rather than you. We complete thorough background and credit checks on all tenants.</p>
        <p>As experts in the rental market, we are confident that the annual rental income you actually bank is more than youâ€™d get if you decided to go it alone or use a more traditional service</p>

            <ol>
                <li>You tell us the monthly rental amount that you would be happy to receive.</li>
                <li>We provide an agreement that has been drafted by our solicitors and sets out all of the terms.</li>
                <li> We take over the management of the house and fill it with our professional tenants.</li> 
                <li> You receive your guaranteed rent on your chosen date every month</li>
                <li>We return the house in great condition at the end of the agreed period. We will also consider purchasing the property in the future if of interest to you</li>
